  <h1>You'll Be Safe Here</h1>
  <div>
    <p>[Verse 1]<p>
    Nobody knows, just why we're here<br>
    Could it be fate or random circumstance<br>
    At the right place, at the right time<br>
    Two roads intertwine<br>
    And if the universe conspired<br>
    To meld our lives, to make us, fuel and fire<br>
    Then know wherever you will be<br>
    So too, shall I'll be

    <p>[Chorus]<p>
    Close your eyes, dry your tears<br>
    'Cause when nothing seems clear<br>
    You'll be safe here from the sheer weight<br>
    Of your doubts and fears<br>
    Weary heart, you'll be safe here

    <p>[Verse 2]<p>
    Remember how we laughed until we cried<br>
    At the most stupid things like<br>
    We were so high<br>
    But love was all that we were on, we belong<br>
    And though the world would never understand<br>
    This unlikely union and why it still stands<br>
    Someday, we will be set free<br>
    Pray and believe

    <p>[Chorus]<p>
    When the light disappears<br>
    And when this world's insincere<br>
    You'll be safe here<br>
    When nobody hears you scream<br>
    I'll scream with you<br>
    You'll be safe here (Ooh ooh, Ahh hah ahh)

    <p>[Chorus]<p>
    Save your eyes from your tears<br>
    When everything's unclear<br>
    You'll be safe here from the sheer weight<br>
    Of your doubts and fears wounded heart<br>
    When the light disappears<br>
    And when this world's insincere<br>
    You'll be safe here<br>
    When nobody hears you scream<br>
    I'll scream with you you'll be safe here<br>
    In my arms through the long cold night<br>
    Sleep tight, you'll be safe here<br>
    When no one understands<br>
    I'll believe, you'll be safe<br>
    You'll be safe, you'll be safe here, ooh ooh<br>

    <p>[Outro]<p>
    Put your heart in my hands<br>
    You'll be safe here
</div>
